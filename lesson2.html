    <h1 id="lessonTitle">Lesson 2 - Math and variables</h1>
    <p>
        The second lesson is going to be just doing some basic math (counting by 1 each time you click the button below).
        This is also a <b>basic</b> intro to variables and types.  Note when doing these lessons, make sure you save
        the file and reload the page after every change. If you don't, you might be looking at the old version of the page,
        and that can get frustrating because you'll be chasing down problems that you've already solved.

    // Javascript variables are declared using one of three different keywords: var, const, let. In many older
    // JS tutorials or Stack Overflow answers, you'll see the var keyword used often. Typically, you can just use let
    // instead. I won't get into why at this point, but generally you should stick to let and const.
    // let means that you're declaring a variable, and its value might change at some point, while const
    // indicates that the value will not change ever.
    // Here, we're declaring the 'count' variable with an initial value of 0. It is *very* important that you do not
    // use quotes around the 0, as that changes the type from an integer (a number) to a string.
    let count = 0;
    // next we're setting the initial value of the click counter (line 15) to the variable we just declared. Notice
    // how line 15 has no text in the tag. If we didn't do this next line, it would be blank, but instead it's 0.
    document.getElementById("clickCount").innerText = count;

    // much like lesson 1, we're setting a click event listener to our button
    document.getElementById("clicker").addEventListener(
        "click",
        // which executes this function
        function () {
             // the function is going to run everything within the {curly braces}
             // in this case it's increasing the value of our count variable by 1.
             // The `+=` syntax is just shorthand for `count = count + 1`. You would basically never want to write out
             // the long-hand form.
             count += 1;
             // because the `count` variable isn't "bound" to the clickCount element, we need to set it again
             document.getElementById("clickCount").innerText = count;
             // when you click the button, the `count` variable increases by 1, and sets the resulting value to the
             // element's text again.
        }
    )
    // Great. Clicking the button updates the counter. What are you going supposed to do now?
    // Well, remember how I said it was super important not to write `let count = "0";`? Go ahead and place quotes
    // on line 26 and see how that affects this. Update that and then read on.

    // Seriously, do it before you keep reading.

    // You'll notice that each click adds a "1" to the end of the text. Why is this? It's because Javascript is a
    // "weakly-typed" language, mean there are implicit type conversions. This can create a whole host of problems,
    // but can also make it easy to get into initially. JS is doing its best to guess what you mean, and because it
    // can't figure out that "0" is a number, it assumes you just want to add "1" to the end of the string.

    // Now remove the quotes from line 26 that you added, and change line 40 to decrement the number on click instead of
    // incrementing it. You can figure out how to do that.
