        The first lesson is going to be very simple and just demonstrate how JavaScript works in relation to HTML.
        You have a cursory understanding of HTML. This is going to be "vanilla" Javascript (e.g. no use of
        frameworks or libraries, such as jQuery). The button below will change header of this page from "Lesson 1" to
        "Lesson 1 Done".
    </p>
    <button id="titleChange">Click me senpai</button>
    <h3 id="emptyBlock"></h3>
</body>
<script>
    // 'document' refers to the entire web page, the '.' after 'document' means "we want to access an attribute
    // of this item". Refer to W3Schools for figuring out everything inside of it:
    // https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp
    // So when we call 'getElementById', we're accessing an element of the document, and specifiying the id
    // of that element. Notice how in line 14, we define the 'id' of the button as "titleChange". So we're accessing
    // that element.
    // If this is confusing, think of it like the document is an apple, and you're calling apple.getElementById("stem")
    // to just reference the stem of that apple.
    // next we call 'addEventListener', which does exactly like it says. It adds something to that element. In this case,
    // it adds a function which listens for a specific action
    document.getElementById("titleChange").addEventListener(
        // we're telling the element to run (execute) the function when someone clicks on it
        "click",
        // this function takes no arguments, because we don't actually care about anything other than the click itself
        // arguments are within the parenthesis. Javascript is a bit different from many languages in that you
        // don't actually need to specify arguments when defining a function, even if (like in this case), there are
        // going to be arguments passed to it anyway (ignore these for now)
        function () {
            // here, we're doing the same thing, we're getting the 'lessonTitle' element (line 5), and doing something
            // to it. In this case, we're changing the text in the 'innerHTML' attribute. How do you remember that's
            // the attribute that needs changed? Again, just reference W3Schools.
            document.getElementById("lessonTitle").innerHTML = "Lesson 1 Done";
        }
    )
    // Great. Clicking the button updates the text. What are you going supposed to do now?
    // Well, there's an empty text field on line 16 with the id 'emptyBlock'. Change the function on line 14 to, when
    // the button is clicked, update the text in that field to something like "Yay me! I did it!"
