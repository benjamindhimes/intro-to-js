    <h1>Lesson 3 - Functions, Type Conversions</h1>
    <p>
        Carrying over from Lesson 2, let's expand our click counter.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now have two counters, one button, and a number input field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Go ahead and click the button, and notice how the first counter increases by 1 and the second counter
        decreases by the same amount. Now change the number in the <span class="bold">Incremental Value</span> field,
        and click the button again.
    </p>
    <p>
        <label class="bold" for="incrementalValue">Incremental Value</label>
        <!-- Note how we use `type="number"` here to make this input only take numbers -->
        <input id="incrementalValue" type="number" value="1">
    </p>
    <button id="clicker">Click me senpai</button>
    <p id="counter1">0</p>
    <p id="counter2">0</p>
</body>

    // We're going to declare our first named functions here
    // `increment` and `decrement` are basically the same, but they either increment of decrement the value
    // and they each act on a different counter
    // `increment` acts on counter1
    // `decrement` acts on counter2
    // they take a single argument, an integer named `incrementalValue`
    function increment(incrementalValue) {
        // we're going to declare the `counter` constant the object of `document.getElementById(...` so we
        // don't need to keep typing the whole document.get... each time we need to reference it.
        // even though this is a constant, we can still change the attributes of it.
        const counter = document.getElementById("counter1");
        // now, going back to lesson 2, we want to change the value by an integer rather than a string
        // in order to do that, we have to type convert the HTML string into an int by calling the `parseInt` function
        // on the value of the HTML
        // this changes '1' to 1
        const originalValue = parseInt(counter.innerHTML);
        // now we're going to set the counter's HTML value to the changed value (original value + incremental value)
        counter.innerHTML = originalValue + incrementalValue;
    }

    function decrement(incrementalValue) {
        // same thing as increment, but we're working on `counter2`
        const counter = document.getElementById("counter2");
        const originalValue = parseInt(counter.innerHTML);
        // and we're decrementing the value
        counter.innerHTML = originalValue - incrementalValue;
    }

    document.getElementById("clicker").addEventListener(
        "click",
        function () {
            // just like in line 56, we need to convert the string value of the Incremental Value field to an int
            // so that we can do arithmetic on the value
            const incrementalValue = parseInt(document.getElementById("incrementalValue").value);
            // next we call the `increment` function and pass the integer as an argument (remember: args go inside
            // the parentheses)
            increment(incrementalValue);
            // and again with `decrement`
            decrement(incrementalValue);
        }
    )
    // You'll notice that can type decimal numbers into the Incremental Value field, but it only ever updates by
    // integers. This is because we convert the string to an integer specifically in line 75.
    // Go ahead and change `parseInt` to `parseFloat` in line 75 and then type a decimal number like 2.3
    // into Incremental Value, and observe the results. Hit the button a few times and notice it doesn't seem to be
    // working correctly. Instead of increasing from 2.3 to 4.6, it increases from 2.3 to 4.3
    // That's because we're still converting the strings of counter1 and counter2 to integers
    // in lines 57 and 65. Thus, it's adding 2.3 to 2 instead of adding 2.3 to 2.3
    // The program is working correctly, but not working how we intend, because we didn't give
    // the computer the right instructions.

    // Exercise: add a new input like the one in line 34, make sure you assign it an ID, and then increment the value
    // of counter1 by the amount in the new input, while decrementing the value of the counter2 by the original input.
