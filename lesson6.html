    <h1>Lesson 6 - Objects n'at</h1>
    <p>
        Having a table that's already completed isn't super helpful. Let's allow the user to make
        their own table, calculating the score as we go.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span id="scoreText">Score: </span>
        <span id="score"></span>
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Question</th>
                <th>Correct?</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="tableBody">
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <button id="addCorrectNode">Add Correct Row</button>
    <button id="addIncorrectNode">Add Incorrect Row</button>

</body>
<script>

    // we're going to have to calculate the score at the end, so let's start with declaring our variables, and
    // initializing their values at 0
    let corrects = 0;
    let incorrects = 0;

    // a function with a capital first letter, such as this, is an object constructor.
    // this constructor takes two arguments: `correctness` and `idx`
    function Row(correctness, idx) {
        // the `this` keyword refers to the object for inside the curly braces.
        // when we set `this.rowNode`, we are creating an attribute of the Row called `rowNode` and setting its value
        // in this case, we are creating a document element object of the table-row type ('tr' in the DOM)
        this.rowNode = document.createElement("tr");
        // we are setting the class name of this row as "bodyRow", because we'll use that later to count the rows
        this.rowNode.className = "bodyRow";
        // we are then setting the value of the internal HTML (all the HTML within the element) to a row we're creating
        this.rowNode.innerHTML = "<td>" + idx + "</td><td>" + correctness + "</td>";
    }

    // this function takes a string arg `correctness`. We should pass only either "Correct" or "Incorrect" into it
    function addRow(correctness) {
        // we get all the bodyRow class elements we've created (line 70), we'll use these to know how many rows we
        // have at row creation, and increment by 1 each time to get the index (`idx`) to create the next row
        const bodyRows = document.getElementsByClassName("bodyRow");
        // we construct a Row object using the `new` operator. It's saying "we want to create a new object of the Row
        // type, using the parameters we're specifying. Some objects, like Python, do this implicitly.
        const row = new Row(correctness, bodyRows.length+1);
        // we are then going to add this row node to the end of the table body
        document.getElementById("tableBody").appendChild(row.rowNode);
        return 0;
    }

    // function used to calculate score, we should call this each time the table gets updated
    function calculateScore() {
        // It's rare that we would care about the score of a test beyond 2 decimal places.
        // Having a score like 14.67777777778 would be unwieldy to look at, so we're going to create a number
        // formatter that limits the maximum digits after the decimal to 2.
        // First, we'll need to create an object that hold our options. Creating an object this way
        // (without a constructor) is called an object literal.
        const options = {
            // we're assigning it a single attribute: `maximumFractionDigits` and setting that to 2
            maximumFractionDigits: 2
        }
        // we are then creating a formatter object from the Intl.NumberFormat constructor, and passing our
        // localization info ("en-US") into it, along with our options object we've created.
        const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", options);
        // we're formatting our float as a string with our formatter here to set that score to our readable number
        document.getElementById("score").innerText = formatter.format(corrects / (corrects + incorrects) * 100);
    }

    // much like we had been doing with `addEventListener` before, setting the `onclick` function just makes that
    // a bit more terse.
    document.getElementById("addCorrectNode").onclick = function () {
        corrects++;
        addRow("Correct");
        calculateScore();
    };
    document.getElementById("addIncorrectNode").onclick = function () {
        incorrects++;
        addRow("Incorrect");
        calculateScore();
    };

    // Exercise: Create a third button which clears the table completely, but which allows the "Add Rows" buttons to
    // work afterward. Change the 'scoreText' element to give the user a hint to use the button before the score will
    // be displayed. After the user has pressed a button at least once, and we have a score, change this to "Score :"
